          (Eph. 2:8). Likewise: “It has been freely given to you to believe in Christ” (Phil. 1:29).

          <h4>
          The fact that some receive from God the gift of faith within time, and that others do not, stems from his eternal decree. 
          For “all his works are known to God from eternity” (Acts 15:18; Eph. 1:11). In accordance with this decree God graciously softens the hearts, 
          however hard, of the elect and inclines them to believe, but by a just judgment God leaves in their wickedness and hardness of heart those who 
          have not been chosen. And in this especially is disclosed to us God’s act—unfathomable, and as merciful as it is just—of distinguishing between 
          people equally lost. This is the well-known decree of election and reprobation revealed in God’s Word. The wicked, impure, and unstable distort 
          this decree to their own ruin, but it provides holy and godly souls with comfort beyond words.

          <h3 style='padding-bottom:20px'><b>Article 7: Election</b></h3>
          <h4>
          Election is God’s unchangeable purpose by which he did the following:
          <p />Before the foundation of the world, by sheer grace, according to the free good pleasure of his will, 
          God chose in Christ to salvation a definite number of particular people out of the entire human race, 
          which had fallen by its own fault from its original innocence into sin and ruin. Those chosen were neither 
          better nor more deserving than the others, but lay with them in the common misery. God did this in Christ, whom he also appointed from eternity 
          to be the mediator, the head of all those chosen, and the foundation of their salvation. <p />
          And so God decreed to give to Christ those chosen for salvation, and to call and draw them effectively into Christ’s 
          fellowship through the Word and Spirit. In other words, God decreed to grant them true faith in Christ, to justify them, 
          to sanctify them, and finally, after powerfully preserving them in the fellowship of the Son, to glorify them. <p />
          God did all this in order to demonstrate his mercy, to the praise of the riches of God’s glorious grace.<p />
          As Scripture says, “God chose us in Christ, before the foundation of the world, so that we should be holy and blameless before 
          him with love; he predestined us whom he adopted as his children through Jesus Christ, in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
          to the praise of his glorious grace, by which he freely made us pleasing to himself in his beloved” (Eph. 1:4-6). And elsewhere, 
          “Those whom he predestined, he also called; and those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified, he also glorified” (Rom. 8:30).

          <h4>
          This election is not of many kinds, but one and the same for all who were to be saved in the Old and the New Testament. 
          For Scripture declares that there is a single good pleasure, purpose, and plan of God’s will, by which he chose us from eternity both 
          to grace and to glory, both to salvation and to the way of salvation, which God prepared in advance for us to walk in.

          <h4>
          This same election took place, not on the basis of foreseen faith, of the obedience of faith, of holiness, or of any other good quality and disposition, 
          as though it were based on a prerequisite cause or condition in the person to be chosen, but rather for the purpose of faith, of the obedience of faith, 
          of holiness, and so on. Accordingly, election is the source of every saving good. Faith, holiness, and the other saving gifts, and at last eternal life itself, 
          flow forth from election as its fruits and effects. As the apostle says, “He chose us” (not because we were, but) 
          “so that we should be holy and blameless before him in love” (Eph. 1:4).

          But the cause of this undeserved election is exclusively the good pleasure of God. This does not involve God’s choosing certain 
          human qualities or actions from among all those possible as a condition of salvation, but rather involves adopting certain particular 
          persons from among the common mass of sinners as God’s own possession. As Scripture says, “When the children were not yet born, and had 
          done nothing either good or bad . . . , she (Rebecca) was told, ‘The older will serve the younger.’ As it is written, ‘Jacob I loved, 
          but Esau I hated’” (Rom. 9:11-13). Also, “All who were appointed for eternal life believed” (Acts 13:48).

          Assurance of their eternal and unchangeable election to salvation is given to the chosen in due time, 
          though by various stages and in differing measure. Such assurance comes not by inquisitive searching 
          into the hidden and deep things of God, but by noticing within themselves, with spiritual joy and holy 
          delight, the unmistakable fruits of election pointed out in God’s Word—such as a true faith in Christ, 
          a childlike fear of God, a godly sorrow for their sins, a hunger and thirst for righteousness, and so on.

          <h4>
          In their awareness and assurance of this election, God’s children daily find greater cause to humble themselves before God, 
          to adore the fathomless depth of God’s mercies, to cleanse themselves, and to give fervent love in return to the One who first 
          so greatly loved them. This is far from saying that this teaching concerning election, and reflection upon it, make God’s 
          children lax in observing his commandments or carnally self-assured. By God’s just judgment this does usually happen to those 
          who casually take for granted the grace of election or engage in idle and brazen talk about it but are unwilling to walk in the 
          ways of the chosen.

          intended, this teaching must be set forth with a spirit of discretion, in a godly and holy manner, 
          at the appropriate time and place, without inquisitive searching into the ways of the Most High. 
          This must be done for the glory of God’s most holy name, and for the lively comfort of God’s people.

          <h4>
          Moreover, Holy Scripture most especially highlights this eternal and undeserved grace of our election and brings 
          it out more clearly for us, in that it further bears witness that not all people have been chosen but that some 
          have not been chosen or have been passed by in God’s eternal election—those, that is, concerning whom God, on the 
          basis of his entirely free, most just, irreproachable, and unchangeable good pleasure, made the following decree: <p />
          to leave them in the common misery into which, by their own fault, they have plunged themselves; not to grant them 
          saving faith and the grace of conversion; but finally to condemn and eternally punish those who have been left in 
          their own ways and under God’s just judgment, not only for their unbelief but also for all their other sins, in 
          order to display his justice.<p />
          And this is the decree of reprobation, which does not at all make God the author of sin (a blasphemous thought!) 
          but rather its fearful, irreproachable, just judge and avenger.

          hand, those who seriously desire to turn to God, to be pleasing to God alone, and to be delivered from the body of 
          death, but are not yet able to make such progress along the way of godliness and faith as they would like—such people 
          ought much less to stand in fear of the teaching concerning reprobation, since our merciful God has promised not to 
          snuff out a smoldering wick or break a bruised reed.* However, those who have forgotten God and their Savior Jesus 
          Christ and have abandoned themselves wholly to the cares of the world and the pleasures of the flesh—such people have 
          every reason to stand in fear of this teaching, as long as they do not seriously turn to God. *Isaiah 42:3

          Since we must make judgments about God’s will from his Word, which testifies that the children of believers are holy, 
          not by nature but by virtue of the gracious covenant in which they together with their parents are included, godly 
          parents ought not to doubt the election and salvation of their children whom God calls out of this life in infancy.

          <h4>
          To those who complain about this grace of an undeserved election and about the severity of a just reprobation, 
          we reply with the words of the apostle, “Who are you, O man, to talk back to God?” (Rom. 9:20), and with the 
          words of our Savior, “Have I no right to do what I want with my own?” (Matt. 20:15). We, however, with reverent 
          adoration of these secret things, cry out with the apostle: “Oh, the depths of the riches both of the wisdom 
          and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond tracing out! For who has known 
          the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? Or who has first given to God, that God should repay him? 
          For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen” (Rom. 11:33-36).
